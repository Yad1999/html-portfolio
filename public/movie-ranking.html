<h1>The Best Movies (According to me of course)</h1>

<h2>My top three movies of all time! Woohoo!!!</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Digimon Adventure: Last Evolution Kizuna</h3>
<p>This movie for me is purely nostalgia and has a sad but beautiful ending for a childhood series.
    I believe that they made this movie to give all of us old heads a great ending to a great series showing how
    we may outgrow all of our past hobbies but as long as we still have some passion towards them, they will never
    disappear and will follow along with us in our own life adventures.

<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>This one's a classic one for all studio ghibli fans out there. I mean what can I say,
    beautiful art style, beautiful story, beautiful world building. It's a great childhood movie
    for all imaginative and creative people.

<h3>Pokemon 3: The Movie</h3>
<p>Ah another childhood movie. This might as well be a favourite childhood movie list at this point.
    Other than that lol, I think one of the main characters (the daughter of the father that died but I think was brought back from the dead lol)
    has a great back story although sad. Having to grow up by herself and having an imaginary but great father figure from her own imagination.
